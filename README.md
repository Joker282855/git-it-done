# Git-it-Done

# Description
This was a module that had us create a website that listed the different types of repositories that could be found 
on a person's github profile. The user is able to search for a specific repository by name or they can find a repostiory
based on three different languages. Those languages are HTML, CSS, and Javascript

# Module Tasks
1. The user was able to search for a specific respository
2. The respository searched for shows up on the right side of the screen
3. Create the buttons that allow the user to search repositories by topic
4. Have the topic buttons bring up respositories when clicked on

# Tasks Achieved By

following the directions given in the lessons for this module.
